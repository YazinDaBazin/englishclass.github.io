            <h1>The Alchemist</h1>
            <p>The Alchemist is my favourite book I've ever read, the book was about a shepherd, wanting to persuade his dreams by going to the pyramids, and meets a lot of people. while reading the book we had book clubs, and <br> we had 4, for each book club in their groups, and everyone in the book club had different topics to work on. There was 4 topics Theme Tracker, Quote Finder, Researcher, and Summarizer, and everyone had a chance to do different <br> one for each book clubs, there were 4 book clubs. A theme tracker is supposed to get 3 quotes from the book and find the theme in that quote. A quote finder is supposed to get 3 quotes and find significant passages from it. <br> </p>
