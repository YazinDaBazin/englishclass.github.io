                <h1>About R&J</h1>
                <p>&emsp;Through out the journey of the semester we read 2 books, and one of the books was Romeo and Juliet, it is a book written by William Shakespear. Romeo and Juliet is one of the most popular books <br> of all time in history, and I am sure that you probaly heard the name of the book before or even read the book. The book is about Romeo and Juliet falling in love at first sight, but their family is an enemy with <br> eachother, and this causes a huge problem, but Romeo and Juliet still continues to fall in love with each other... This is a small part of the book, the exticment happens after. After reading the book we had <br> to pick a scence that my teacher assigned us, and we had turn the scene into a modern time scene.  </p>
